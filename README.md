# [MPT Food Recipes](https://)

Third Project for my Diploma Course with the Code Institute, I read a suggestion/idea in the outline section to the milestone project.  As I work as a Personal Trainer I have lots of food recipes and always getting ask about ideas for meals to eat.  Build this site will give me a way of archiving the recipes and allow my clients to see and read them while allowing them to share any recipes or ideas with  other people.
